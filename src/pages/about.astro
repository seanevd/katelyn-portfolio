	<p>
		I am a product designer with over 8 years of experience designing and building digitally-focused products and services. I am currently researching and designing digital tools to support the Artemis Moon program at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California.
	</p>

	<p>
		I like designing things with people. Not just designing things with people in mind, but designing things WITH people. I like to learn about them and how they address the problems they face. I like to figure out whether and how technology could fit into their lives and make things easier.
	</p>

	<p>
		My specialty is UI/UX design, product strategy, user research, and  design systems in both mobile and web-based applications. I value simple interfaces that prioritize accessibility and I strive to methodically  step through problems in order to better understand the why before I get  to the what.
	</p>

	<p>
		I like to run and float in pools of water. I bake whenever I can - most often bagels and baguettes. I like to be outside and I like feeling full of GOOD food. I am also raising two incredible humans, an experience that has impacted every part of who I am.
	</p>

	<p>
		I am open to full time design work with a human-centered team focused on  exploring tough human challenges. I would love to work with you!
