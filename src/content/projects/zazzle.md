### PROJECT SUMMARY

Over the course of an 8 month capstone project through CMU MHCI program, I was part of a team of designers and researchers that worked **to design and develop a solution to make product customization more accessible to Zazzle customers.** Working alongside our clients at Zazzle Inc, our team worked to explore and envision new ways to support creativity and collaboration. **I worked at the design and technical lead on our team,** managing project timelines, scope, strategy as well as planning and conducting user research, ideation, and creating coded prototypes and final design assets.
